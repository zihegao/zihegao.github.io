We're seeking passionate students who are interested in photonic devices and advanced sensing/imaging systems. We also welcome undergraduate researchers and summer interns.

If at least two of the following areas resonate with you, our research might be a good fit for you:
- **Coding and Prototyping**: Designing both hardware and software to create innovative sensing systems.
- **Physics**: Understanding the fundamental behaviors and pursuing the performance limits of quantum optical systems and topological systems.
- **Microfabrication**: Working in the cleanroom to fabricate laser arrays and semiconductor chips.
  
Want to become a part of our lab? Send me an <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="email">email <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a> with your CV (please include your GPA on your CV) and a brief expression of your interest.

**Auburn University and the city**: Auburn University is a public research university located in Auburn, Alabama, and is one of the state's two flagship public universities. According to the 2024 USNews rankings, Auburn University ranks 93rd overall in the US, with its engineering school ranking 55th. In addition to being an R1 Carnegie research institution, Auburn Engineering research is ranked among the nation’s top 50 in research expenditures. We’re right in the automotive industry, and also 3.5 hrs from Cummings Research Park (the world’s 4th largest research park).


Auburn is recognized as one of the "Best Small Towns in the US". It has a mild climate and offers easy access to major cities, beaches, and mountain recreational activities. The Auburn-Opelika-Columbus metropolitan area, located along the rapidly developing I-85 corridor between Atlanta, GA, and Montgomery, AL, has a population of over 500,000. Auburn has been rated as one of the best places to live in the US by [CNNMoney](https://blog.al.com/montgomery/2012/08/auburn_no_89_on_cnnmoneys_100.html), USNews, [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/places/al/auburn/?sh=4b1011b07a63), and recently, [Livability](https://livability.com/list/top-100-best-places-to-live/2018/10?page=9).
