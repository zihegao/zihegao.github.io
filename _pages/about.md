We are at the forefront of pioneering next-generation photonic devices and systems tailored for imaging, communications, and computing.


Photons are unmatched in their role as carriers of information. They shape our understanding of the world, enabling us to perceive and relay information both naturally through our eyes and technologically via mediums like optical fibers, cameras, sensors, and machine vision. As emerging technologies, including wearable, implantable devices, and autonomous systems, come to the fore, they bring with them specific challenges — for example, in terms of size, weight, and power. Traditional optical systems fall short of these rigorous demands.


To bridge this gap, our research steers through three revolutionary pathways promising major technological advancements:
- **Innovative Optical Sources**: Distributed, ultrafast, and reconfigurable laser arrays.
- **Meta-Optics**: Endowed with information processing capabilities.
- **Quantum-Enhanced Techniques**: Going beyond the classical limits of optical sensing and imaging.


By harnessing the synergy of heterogeneously integrated photonic and microelectronic chips, we delve into devices and systems that are not only compact and robust but also scalable in terms of manufacturing.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
