Our [PRL paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.183801) on high-purity generation and switching of twisted single photons is now online. Lots of fun memories with this one especially the thrill to confirm OAM-carrying single photons with an SLM. We essentially wrote the code to control the SLM together in a sushi restaurant.
