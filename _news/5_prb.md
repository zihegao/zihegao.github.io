Our [PRB paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.134102) on non-Hermitian gauged reciprocity and symmetry is now online. We theoreticall
show that with non-reciprocal coupling, the Lorentz reciprocity is broken but a "non-Hermitian guaged" reciprocity emerges. These non-Hermitian systems 
are counterintuitive and we are finding new intuitions to guide our understanding of these interesting systems.
