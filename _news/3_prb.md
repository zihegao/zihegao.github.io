Our [PRB paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.104111) is now online. We explain why pumping either the head or tail of the non-Hermitian skin mode results in the same lasing threshold â€” a notably counterintuitive finding! One would think pumping the 'head' region (i.e., where the mode is localized at) results in more efficient pumping and lower threshold. Well, in non-Hermitian gauged systems with asymmetric coupling, this conventional wisdom fails.
