Our [Nature Photonics paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-024-01579-9) (by Penn) on non-Hermitian hybrid silicon photonic switching is now online. 
The non-Hermitian switching is enabled by modulating the gain/loss in the active layer (heterogeneously integrated on Si) and hence breaking or conserving
the parity-time symmetry. 8x8 switches (and 4x4 with 1470-1510nm multiwavelength input) are demonstrated. The switching dynamics is fast (100 ps).
