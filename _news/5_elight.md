Our [elight paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43593-024-00066-6), "Integrated preparation and manipulation of high-dimensional flying structured photons", is now online. 
More fun in high-dimensional (SU(4)) spin-orbit space. The entangled photons are generated in a nonlinear crystal and the signal photon is coupled to an integrated chip, where it can be projected on-demand to a state in
the 4D Hilbert space (represented by a high-order Poincare sphere (HOPS)), which is a "qudit" with d=4. We also showed a (simple) cluster state.
